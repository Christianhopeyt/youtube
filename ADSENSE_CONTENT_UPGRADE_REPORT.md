# Norlytics Full Weak Page Quality Upgrade Report

Audit/update date: July 22, 2026

## Executive Summary

Norlytics previously had six English articles and six French counterparts quarantined with `noindex, follow` because they were thin, templated, and excluded from the sitemap. This update rewrites them into indexable creator resources instead of hiding them. No page was removed. No page currently deserves `noindex` after this pass.

## Pages Improved

| Page | Why Google may have skipped indexing | Unique value added | Before | After |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| /blog/ai-tools-for-youtube-creators | Thin generic AI list; little original workflow value | Full AI production workflow, examples, QA checklist, screenshot placeholder, internal links | Low | Strong |
| /blog/grow-youtube-channel-fast | Generic growth advice and duplicated template | Public-data growth framework, baseline method, topic clusters, packaging/retention tables | Low | Strong |
| /blog/youtube-cpm-countries | CPM topic overlapped with revenue pages but lacked country methodology | Country/RPM explanation, public geography limits, chart placeholder, country-use guidance | Low | Strong |
| /blog/youtube-rpm-by-niche | Thin RPM table concept with risk of misleading claims | Responsible RPM scenario method, niche comparison table, examples, validation workflow | Low | Strong |
| /blog/youtube-shorts-monetization | Short templated page for a complex policy topic | Shorts revenue model, YPP thresholds, eligible-view caveats, hybrid Shorts/long-form workflow | Low | Strong |
| /blog/youtube-sponsorship-guide | Generic monetization article; no pricing or deal framework | Sponsor scorecard, pricing factors, deliverables, red flags, public-data evaluation method | Low | Strong |
| /fr/blog/... counterparts | Noindexed duplicates of weak English pages | French-language versions with localized summaries, tables, FAQs, sources, and internal links | Low | Medium/Strong |

## Improvements Made

- Removed `noindex, follow` from the rewritten weak articles and French counterparts.
- Re-added all rewritten pages to `sitemap.xml` with 2026-07-22 lastmod dates.
- Reintroduced rewritten pages to EN and FR blog discovery surfaces.
- Added Article and FAQ structured data to each rewritten article.
- Added author blocks, methodology notes, update timestamps, source links, examples, tables, screenshot/chart placeholders, and practical creator checklists.
- Strengthened topic clusters across YouTube Analytics, Revenue, Shorts, Sponsorships, AI workflows, and Niche Research.
- Expanded About with editorial transparency, public-data methodology limits, correction process, and no unsupported exact-revenue claims.
- Expanded Contact with an explicit path for corrections and methodology feedback.
- Removed a third-party ad-script placement from the blog index that could weaken AdSense trust.

## Overlap Decisions

- `youtube-cpm-countries` overlaps with `how-much-youtube-pays-per-view` and `youtube-rpm-vs-cpm`, but now serves a distinct country/geography intent.
- `youtube-rpm-by-niche` overlaps with revenue guides, but now focuses on niche scenario planning and responsible benchmark use.
- `youtube-shorts-monetization` overlaps with monetization requirements, but now focuses on Shorts-specific revenue mechanics and hybrid strategy.
- `youtube-sponsorship-guide` overlaps with affiliate/membership revenue, but now focuses on brand deals, deliverables, and pricing.
- No improved page is a pure duplicate after this rewrite.

## Pages That Genuinely Deserve Noindex

None found in this pass. The previously quarantined pages were weak but salvageable, so they were improved and kept indexable.

## Remaining Weak Pages

- French pages are improved and indexable, but they are shorter than the English flagship versions. They should be expanded further if French organic search becomes a priority.
- Older indexed articles should be periodically refreshed with more screenshots, examples, and updated policy references.
- DNS records are now consistent (apex and `www` point to Netlify targets as of August 7, 2026); consent behavior and Search Console indexing should still be re-checked after deployment.

## Recommended Search Console Indexing Requests

Request indexing after deployment for:

- /blog
- /creator-dashboard
- /niche-insights
- /about
- /contact

## Quality Principle

This update follows the requested approach: improve weak pages first, use `noindex` only for truly obsolete or duplicated content, and build a more authoritative YouTube analytics resource for both Google Search and AdSense review.
